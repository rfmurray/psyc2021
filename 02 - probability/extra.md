Here is a difficult problem for those of you who like puzzles.  This is completely optional, and I will not test you on it.

Three prisoners, A, B, and C, with apparently equally good records have applied for parole. The parole board has decided to release two of the three, and the prisoners know this but not which two. A warder friend of prisoner A knows who are to be released. Prisoner A realizes that it would be unethical to ask the warder if he, A, is to be released, but thinks of asking for the name of one prisoner other than himself who is to be released. He thinks that before he asks, his chances of release are 2/3. He thinks that if the warder ways "B will be released", his own chances have now gone down to 1/2, because either A and B or B and C are to be released. And so A decides not to reduce his chances by asking. However, A is mistaken in his calculations. Explain.

Note:  Here we're not looking for a completely verbal explanation.  Instead, use the rules of probability to find the probability that A will be released, if he does and if he does not ask the warder.  After you find the answer, compare your reasoning to prisoner A's reasoning, and describe where he went wrong.
