### Problems for lecture 9

Kelley and Donnelly:  14.1 - 14.9 

Also do Urdan's end-of-chapter problems for chapter 12.


note:  Kelley and Donnelly's answers to questions 14.2, 14.4, 14.6, and 14.8 use a different formula for the correlation than the one Urdan uses.  However, Kelley and Donnelly's formula gives the same result as our formula for the sample correlation (the one with n-1 in the denominator, posted in the file correlation.pdf on the course website).
