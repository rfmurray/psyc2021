### Problems for lecture 10 

Kelley and Donnelly:  11.41, 11.43

Kelley and Donnelley use different formulas for some parts of these problems than Urdan does.  To avoid confusion, I have written answers to these problems using Urdan's formulas and methods.  See the file solutions.pdf.

Also do problems 1 and 3 at the end of Urdan's chapter 8.
